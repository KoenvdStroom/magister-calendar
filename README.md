# Magister to Calendar
## WIP
Simple repository I use to transfer my Magister appointments to my Google Calendar.

## Functionality
This NodeJS program makes use of my own [Magister-API-Key package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/magister-api-key) and the Google API. I get an api key for Magister, get a list of all of my appointments, and transfer them one by one to events in Google Calendar.
